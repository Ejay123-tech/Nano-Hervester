# Nano-Hervester
This Streamlit app provides a real-time dashboard for monitoring voltage readings from an Arduino board.
It displays live voltage data, timestamps, and updates automatically — allowing you to visualize how voltage changes over time.

If no Arduino connection is available, the app simulates voltage readings to demonstrate the dashboard’s functionality.

# Features
✅ Real-time voltage monitoring
✅ Dynamic line chart and data table
✅ Automatic data refresh and visualization
✅ Simulated data mode (for testing without hardware)
✅ Works entirely in Streamlit — no extra GUI needed
